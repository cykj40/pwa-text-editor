  ## About
  ```md
  For this application I used indexedDB as the database. I used webpack to bundle the front end . 
  I also used workbox to create a service worker that caches static assets. Finally I deployed the 
  finished product to Heroku for  deployment.
```
  ## User Story
  ```md
  AS A developer
  I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
  SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
   ```
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  ```md
  GIVEN a text editor web application
  WHEN I open my application in my editor
  THEN I should see a client server folder structure
  WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
  THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
  WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
  THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
  WHEN I run my webpack plugins
  THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
  WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
  THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
  WHEN I open the text editor
  THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
  WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
  WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
  WHEN I click on the Install button
  THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
  WHEN I load my web application
  THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
  WHEN I register a service worker
  THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
  WHEN I deploy to Heroku
  THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
  ```
